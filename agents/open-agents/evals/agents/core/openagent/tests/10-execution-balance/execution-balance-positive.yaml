name: Execution Balance - Read before execution
description: |
  Tests the execution-balance evaluator.
  
  The execution-balance evaluator checks that agents read/inspect
  before executing write operations. This prevents blind writes.
  
  This test asks the agent to read a file - a simple read-only operation
  that should pass the execution-balance check (reads are always OK).
