> Maestro hones fractured attention into focused intent.

Maestro is a cross-platform desktop app for orchestrating your fleet of AI agents and projects. It's a high-velocity solution for hackers who are juggling multiple projects in parallel. Designed for power users who live on the keyboard and rarely touch the mouse.

Collaborate with AI to create detailed specification documents, then let Auto Run execute them automatically, each task in a fresh session with clean context. Allowing for long-running unattended sessions, my current record is nearly 24 hours of continuous runtime.

Run multiple agents in parallel with a Linear/Superhuman-level responsive interface. Currently supporting **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, and **OpenCode** with plans for additional agentic coding tools (Aider, Gemini CLI, Qwen3 Coder) based on user demand.
