name: "ContextScout: Negative Test - Ambiguous Query Handling"
description: |
  Tests that ContextScout handles vague/ambiguous queries appropriately.
  
  This is a NEGATIVE test that verifies the agent:
  - Recognizes when a query is too vague
  - Asks for clarification or provides guidance
  - Doesn't return random/irrelevant files
  - Suggests specific search terms
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - SHOULD recognize query is vague
  - SHOULD ask for clarification OR make reasonable assumptions
  - MUST NOT return completely irrelevant files
  - SHOULD suggest more specific queries
  
  This test SHOULD FAIL if:
  - Agent returns random unrelated files
  - Agent doesn't acknowledge ambiguity
  - Agent provides unhelpful results

# Expected outcome: Agent should either:
# 1. Ask for clarification ("What kind of stuff?")
# 2. Provide general overview of available context
# 3. Suggest specific search terms
# 
# Agent should NOT just return random files
