# OpenCode Plugin Adapter

This package serves as a placeholder for the OpenCode editor integration.

## Usage
1.  Install the `super-ai-vscode` extension in your OpenCode editor (since OpenCode is often VSCode-compatible).
2.  Configure the socket connection to `http://localhost:3000`.
3.  The Hub will detect the connection via `HealthService`.
