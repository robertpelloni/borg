name: "ContextScout: Negative Test - Invalid Path Handling"
description: |
  Tests that ContextScout handles non-existent directories gracefully.
  
  This is a NEGATIVE test that verifies the agent:
  - Detects when a path doesn't exist
  - Reports the error clearly
  - Doesn't attempt to read from invalid paths
  - Suggests checking the path
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - MUST detect path doesn't exist
  - MUST report error clearly
  - MUST NOT attempt to read non-existent files
  - SHOULD suggest alternatives
  
  This test SHOULD FAIL if:
  - Agent tries to read from non-existent path
  - Agent claims to find files in invalid directory
  - Agent doesn't report the error
