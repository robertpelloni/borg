# Vision: AI Operating System

## Core Philosophy
AIOS (AI Operating System) is a meta-orchestrator for AI tools and agents. It provides a unified hub connecting MCP servers, CLI tools, and agent frameworks into a cohesive intelligent system.

## Technical Pillars
1.  **Orchestration:** Universal hub for MCP tools, agents, and AI CLIs.
2.  **Intelligence:** Agent execution, memory systems, and context management.
3.  **Infrastructure:** Extensible plugin architecture with support for:
    -   Local MCP servers
    -   Remote service integrations
    -   Hardware device connections

## The Super AI Plugin Role
This plugin acts as the software layer connecting AI tools and services.
-   **Core Service:** Manages agents, tools, memory, and orchestration.
-   **Clients (Browser/CLI):** Act as the interface for the user to interact with the AI system.
