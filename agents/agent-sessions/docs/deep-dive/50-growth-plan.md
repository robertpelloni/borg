# Growth Plan (reach 1,000 stars and build a real distribution engine)

This plan assumes:
- You keep the product local-first.
- You avoid cloud sync as a default (trust advantage).
- You ship one hero workflow that users can explain to a friend in one sentence.

## Where you are now (baseline)

As of 2026-01-01:
- 159 GitHub stars
- ~1.2k total release downloads (mostly DMGs)
- 2 open issues (low noise, good)

This is not “viral”. It is “early product with signs of life”.

## The honest path to 1,000 stars

You do not get to 1,000 stars by polishing UI alone.
You get there by:
- trust (license + security posture)
- one hero workflow (Context Pack)
- repeated distribution events (launches, integrations, community presence)

## Positioning: pick one sentence and repeat it everywhere

Recommended:
- “A local-first session browser and memory layer for terminal AI coding (Codex, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode).”

Or more aggressive:
- “Stop re-explaining your project to your coding agent: search and resume any past session locally.”

Do not lead with “analytics” or “git inspector”. Lead with the painkiller.

## Distribution channels (ranked by ROI)

### 1) GitHub (conversion happens here)
Checklist:
- Add a license (without this, contributors and companies will bounce).
- Add a short “Security and Privacy” section:
  - what files are read (paths)
  - what commands are executed (and only on explicit user action)
  - what never leaves the machine
- Add a 30–60 second demo clip (one loop: find -> context pack -> resume).
- Add an “Integrations” section: Crystal, Claude Squad, cc-sessions (even if only “works well with” initially).

### 2) “Show HN” style launch (spike events)
HN likes:
- a clear pain
- a working demo
- and a thoughtful explanation of tradeoffs

Target post:
- “Show HN: Local-first session browser for Codex/Claude/Gemini with context packs to resume work instantly”

Your differentiator vs. “another wrapper UI”:
- multi-agent history and search
- local-first
- context packs as artifacts

### 3) Partner communities (borrow distribution)
These projects have audiences that already want what you build:
- Crystal: https://github.com/stravu/crystal
- Claude Squad: https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad
- cc-sessions: https://github.com/GWUDCAP/cc-sessions
- MCP memory service: https://github.com/doobidoo/mcp-memory-service

Strategy:
- ship lightweight integrations (import/export, worktree grouping)
- then ask maintainers to list Agent Sessions as a recommended companion tool

Note on Reddit:
- Reddit is a large distribution channel for devtools, but automated access was blocked from this environment. If you want Reddit promotion, do it manually with a real account and a genuine “here’s my workflow” post, not a link drop.

### 4) YouTube demos and short clips (highest leverage for UI products)
Plan:
- 3-minute “why this exists” video
- 30-second “Context Pack” clip
- 5-minute “workflow: from old session to shipping a fix” walkthrough

### 5) “Awesome” lists (high-leverage backlinks and discovery)
These lists are where motivated users go when they are assembling their toolchain.
Targets (examples, not exhaustive):
- Awesome Claude Code: https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code
- Awesome Claude Code subagents: https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents
- Awesome Gemini CLI: https://github.com/Piebald-AI/awesome-gemini-cli
- Awesome Codex CLI: https://github.com/milisp/awesome-codex-cli
- Awesome AI coding techniques: https://github.com/inmve/awesome-ai-coding-techniques

Do not “spray and pray” PRs. Submit to the lists that match your core promise (session history, memory, limits tracking).

## Growth loops (built into the product)

If you want organic growth, you need shareable outputs.

### Loop A: Context Pack sharing
- User exports context pack and shares it with a teammate or future-self.
- The pack includes a footer: “Generated by Agent Sessions” (optional, respectful).
- This creates lightweight, non-spam distribution.

### Loop B: Standup summary export
Vibe-log shows that “standup in 2 minutes” is sticky.
If Agent Sessions can generate a local “what changed, what’s next” summary per day/project, that becomes daily usage.

### Loop C: “Session to PR” artifact
If you can attach:
- session summary
- git context at session time
- diff highlights
to a PR description template, you become part of shipping, not just reading.

## 90-day plan (practical schedule)

### Weeks 1–2: Trust and packaging
- Add LICENSE, SECURITY.md, and security/privacy docs.
- Remove obvious repo ballast (tracked DMGs, logs, backup files) or move them to releases/artifacts.
- Tighten README to one hero loop and one CTA.

### Weeks 3–6: Ship the hero loop
- Context Pack export (MVP first, polish later).
- Command Palette (at least: open session, export pack, resume).
- Make “resume” reliable and boring; handle errors with clear UX.

### Weeks 7–10: Scale and integration
- DB-backed search improvements (FTS) or at least a clear roadmap and benchmark numbers.
- Worktree grouping and “works well with Crystal/Claude Squad” docs.
- Publish integrations doc and a short “how I use this daily” post.

### Weeks 11–13: Launch events
- Show HN post timed with a release that contains Context Pack.
- Ship 2–3 short demo clips.
- Submit PRs to “awesome” lists (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex CLI) and relevant directories.

## Content calendar (10 posts that build momentum)

You need repeated, small “distribution moments” instead of one big launch.

1) “The problem: terminal agent history is fragmented”
2) “Context Pack: stop re-explaining your project”
3) “Limits radar: never get cut off mid-session again”
4) “Git context at session time: what the agent actually saw”
5) “How I search 2,000 sessions in seconds (performance story)”
6) “How Agent Sessions complements Crystal / Claude Squad”
7) “How to recover ‘ancient’ sessions your CLI can’t resume”
8) “Privacy model: local-first, read-only, no telemetry”
9) “Power user shortcuts and command palette”
10) “Roadmap: what we will not build (and why)”

## Monetization (only after trust is fixed)

You can sell this, but the sequence matters:

1) Choose and publish a real license first.
2) Decide on one of:
   - OSS + paid supporter edition (convenience features)
   - open-core (advanced features paid)
   - services/support (teams)

Avoid:
- “we will decide later” positioning; it makes contributors and buyers hesitate.

## One uncomfortable truth

You will not out-feature Crystal or Claude Squad in their lane.
You can win by being the best memory layer and the best cross-agent history viewer, and by integrating into the workflows people already adopted.
