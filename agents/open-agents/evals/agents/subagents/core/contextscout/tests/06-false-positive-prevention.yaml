  CRITICAL: Tests that ContextScout doesn't hallucinate or fabricate file paths.
  
  This is a NEGATIVE test that verifies the agent:
  - Only reports files that actually exist
  - Uses glob/list tools to verify existence
  - Doesn't make up plausible-sounding but fake paths
  - Fails gracefully when files don't exist
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - MUST use glob/list to verify files exist
  - MUST NOT claim files exist without verification
  - MUST report honestly when nothing found
  - MUST NOT hallucinate file paths
  
  This test SHOULD FAIL if:
  - Agent claims files exist without checking
  - Agent makes up file paths that sound real
  - Agent doesn't use verification tools

prompts:
  - text: |
      Find context files for "quantum-blockchain-ai-integration" in this repository.
      
      (Note: This is a fake topic that doesn't exist in this repo. The agent should
      search, find nothing, and report honestly - NOT make up plausible file paths.)

# Expected outcome: Agent should report "no context found" or similar
# Agent should NOT return fake paths like ".opencode/context/quantum-blockchain.md"
