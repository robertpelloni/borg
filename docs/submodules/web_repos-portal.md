# OpenCode Portal

![banner](/banner.png)

> **Disclaimer**: This is a **personal project** and is **not related** to [https://github.com/sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) or the SST team. This portal is a personal-built interface for interacting with OpenCode instances.

A web-based UI for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), the AI coding agent. This portal provides a browser interface to interact with OpenCode sessions, view messages, and chat with the AI assistant.

## Quick Start

### Start OpenCode Server

Navigate to your project directory and run OpenCode using Docker:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Get the current directory name
DIR_NAME=$(basename "$(pwd)")

# Run OpenCode in Docker container
docker run -it --rm -p 4000:4000 \
  -v "$(pwd)":/$DIR_NAME -w /$DIR_NAME \
  -v "$HOME/.gitconfig":/root/.gitconfig:ro \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh":/root/.ssh:ro \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --name opencode \
  ghcr.io/sst/opencode:latest \
  serve --port 4000 --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

> **Note**: Omit the git configuration mounts if you do not need git setup:
> ```bash
> -v "$HOME/.gitconfig":/root/.gitconfig:ro \
> -v "$HOME/.ssh":/root/.ssh:ro \
> ```

This command:
- Gets the current directory name and uses it as the container path
- Maps port 4000 from the container to your host
- Mounts your current directory to a path matching your project directory name in the container
- Mounts your git configuration (`~/.gitconfig`) and SSH keys (`~/.ssh`) for git authentication
- Allows Docker-in-Docker functionality for OpenCode's operations
- Starts the OpenCode server in the background and keeps the container running
- Uses the official OpenCode Docker image from GitHub Container Registry

### Why Run OpenCode as Docker Image?

Running OpenCode in a Docker container provides several benefits:

- **Isolation**: Creates an isolated environment so you cannot mess up something outside the project scope
- **Consistency**: Ensures OpenCode runs with the same dependencies and configuration across different machines
- **Clean Environment**: No need to install OpenCode globally on your system
- **Portability**: Easy to share and reproduce the exact same OpenCode setup
- **Security**: Limits OpenCode's access to only the mounted directories

### Start Portal Development Server

In a new terminal, navigate to the portal directory and start the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set environment variable
export OPENCODE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Run development server
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t opencode-portal .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e OPENCODE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000 opencode-portal
```

### GitHub Container Registry

Pre-built images are available at:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hosenur/portal:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e OPENCODE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000 ghcr.io/hosenur/portal:latest
```

## Overview

OpenCode Portal connects to a running OpenCode server and provides:

- Session management (create, view, delete sessions)
- Real-time chat interface with the AI assistant
- File mention support (`@filename` to reference files)
- Model selection
- Dark/light theme support

## Why This Project?

OpenCode comes with its own official web UI that you can access by running:
```bash
opencode --port 4096
```

However, the official UI is **currently under development** and has some limitations:
- Not mobile responsive
- Limited mobile experience

This project was inspired by my personal need to access OpenCode from my mobile device when I don't have my laptop around. The goal is to provide a mobile-first, responsive interface for interacting with OpenCode instances remotely.

## Use Case

This portal is designed for remote access to your OpenCode instance. Deploy the portal on a VPS alongside OpenCode, then use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (or similar VPN) to securely connect from your mobile device or any other machine.

**Example setup:**
```
[Your Phone] ---(Tailscale)---> [VPS running Portal + OpenCode]
```
