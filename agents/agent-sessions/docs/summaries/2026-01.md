## January 2026

- Preferences: Added Security & Privacy and License links in Settings → About.
- Preferences: Made the Settings → About updates section more compact.
- Preferences: Updated the Droid pane with binary detection and version check controls.
- Copilot: Tool output now renders escaped newlines as real newlines.
- Search: Added SQLite full-text indexing for faster global search after analytics indexing completes.
- Search: Instant search now indexes full tool inputs and outputs for recent sessions (last 90 days), reducing the need to wait for background scanning.
- Search: Tool output indexing now redacts embedded base64/data URL blobs to keep search responsive and the index compact.
- Search: Instant search now uses token-prefix matching by default (for example, `magic` behaves like `magic*`) to improve identifier and structured-text recall without trigram/substr indexing.
- Search: Background scanning of large tool outputs is now opt-in by default, keeping Instant search more responsive (Settings → Advanced).
- Search: Instant search now falls back to legacy matching for sessions not indexed yet, preventing missing results during index warmup.
- Search: Instant indexing now samples long assistant messages and tool inputs (head + middle + tail) to reduce false negatives.
- Indexing: Analytics refresh is now incremental (skips unchanged files and removes deleted ones), reducing repeated startup work.
- Startup: When Codex sessions are already indexed, the app now shows the hydrated list immediately while scanning for newly created sessions in the background.
- Search: Incremental refresh now backfills missing per-session search data so Instant search becomes complete over time.
- Search: Instant indexing now captures more of long tool outputs (head + middle + tail slices) and keeps active Codex sessions searchable while they are updating.
- Sessions: Auto-select the first session on launch so the transcript pane isn’t blank.
- Sessions: Large session message counts no longer jump while background parsing completes.
- Sessions: The unified list now shows a live session count that updates while indexing and when filters/search change.
- UI: Consolidated unified-window status indicators into a single cockpit-style footer.
- UI: In dark mode, the cockpit footer now uses a transparent HUD style with crisp borders instead of a solid fill.
- UI: Menu bar usage now uses the same monospace, logo-forward cockpit styling as the footer.
- Menu Bar: Reset menu items now include weekday; menu bar label can hide reset indicators per provider.
- Menu Bar: Removed pill backgrounds from the menu bar label for a cleaner, more native look.
- Preferences: The Menu Bar pane now groups label options into sections and aligns toggles consistently.
- Usage: Time-only reset strings now roll forward to the next day to avoid showing stale "<1m" countdowns.
- Transcript: Reduced terminal-view stutter by debouncing rebuilds and updating match highlights without full reloads.
- Transcript: Clearing Find now immediately clears match highlights.
- Transcript: Removed the duplicate Jump to First Prompt control from the transcript toolbar.
- Sessions list: The Size column can now be sorted.
- Search: The unified sessions toolbar now shows the global search field by default and displays its keyboard shortcut inline.
- Search: The Search Sessions menu item and ⌥⌘F shortcut now reliably focus the global search field.
- Transcript: The Find field now shows its ⌘F shortcut hint when empty.
- Analytics: The By Agent card now auto-scales rows and falls back to an internal scroll when space is tight.
- UI: Pane sizes now persist when switching between vertical and horizontal split layouts.
- UI: Session list rows are taller with monospaced typography, lighter message counts, and softer timestamp gray, plus footer-blue selection accents.
- UI: Agent colors are slightly softened (Codex coral, Claude lavender), the transcript toolbar spacing is tighter, and the terminal view adds a subtle top border.
- Transcript: Toolbar controls now use monospaced typography to match the session list.
- Transcript: Terminal find highlights no longer linger when the Find query is empty.
- Transcript: Toolbar filters now use dot + count labels with compact navigation chevrons.
- Claude: Opening sessions with embedded base64 blobs (for example, Chrome MCP screenshots) no longer stalls the UI.
