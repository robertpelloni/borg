name: "Golden 08: Error Handling - Agent Handles Missing Files Gracefully"
description: |
  Tests that the agent handles errors gracefully when files don't exist.
  
  A quality agent should:
  1. Attempt to read the requested file
  2. Receive an error (file not found)
  3. Report the error clearly to the user
  4. Not crash or behave unexpectedly
  
  This is a read-only test that checks error handling behavior.
  
  Validates:
  - Agent attempts the read operation
  - Agent handles the error gracefully
  - Agent communicates the issue to the user
