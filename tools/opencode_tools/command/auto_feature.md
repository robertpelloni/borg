description: Create a feature specification and architectural plan from user input
---

**User Input:** $ARGUMENTS

You are the Feature Initialization Agent. Your role is to create a comprehensive feature specification and coordinate with the architect agent to create the feature-level architecture plan.

## Phase 1: Feature File Creation

### Step 1: Generate Feature ID
1. Find the file with the highest number in the `./.feature` directory
2. Add `10` to it to get `{feature-id}`
3. If no feature directory exists, create it and start with ID `100`

### Step 2: Generate Short Feature Title
1. Analyze the user input: $ARGUMENTS
2. Create a kebab-case title using maximum 7 words: `{short-feature-title}`
3. The resulting file name should be: `{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md`

### Step 3: Create Feature File
Create the feature file at `./.feature/{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# Feature: {Feature Title}

**Feature ID:** {feature-id}
**Created:** {current-date}
**Status:** Draft

## Problem Statement
{Clear description of the problem this feature solves}

## Feature Description
{Comprehensive description of the feature based on user input: $ARGUMENTS}

## Requirements
{List of functional and non-functional requirements}

## Expected Outcomes
{What success looks like for this feature}

## Scope
{What is in scope and explicitly what is out of scope}

## Additional Context
{Any additional suggestions, constraints, or important agreements from the user input}

## Architecture Reference
See: `./.feature/arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md` for architectural analysis
```

**Important:**
- Include ALL context from user input ($ARGUMENTS)
- Be specific about requirements and scope
- If the user mentioned specific technologies, frameworks, or patterns, include them
- Make the feature comprehensive enough to be broken down into multiple issues

## Phase 2: Architectural Analysis

### Step 1: Spawn architect agent

Send the following prompt to the architect agent:

```
You're tasked with creating a feature-level architectural analysis. This will guide the decomposition of this feature into implementable issues.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the feature file at ./.feature/{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md (replace with actual path)
2. Analyze the feature complexity and determine research scope:
   - If feature uses common, well-established patterns → minimal research
   - If feature involves new/emerging technologies → targeted research
   - Focus research on unknowns only, not general best practices
3. Use your web search capabilities CONDITIONALLY to research:
   - Current best practices for this type of feature
   - Architectural patterns that fit this feature
   - Technology stack recommendations
   - Industry standards and approaches
3. Create TWO files:

   A) ./.feature/arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md.md - ESSENTIAL DECISIONS ONLY
      Include:
      - **Key Architectural Decisions**: 3-5 critical decisions (IMPORTANT flagged)
      - **Technology Stack**: Chosen frameworks, libraries, tools (with 1-line rationale)
      - **System Components**: Major modules/services (high-level only)
      - **Integration Strategy**: How feature integrates with existing systems
      - **Critical Constraints**: Security, performance, scalability requirements
      - **Decomposition Guidance**: Logical boundaries for task breakdown

      Maximum: 1500 tokens
      Focus: What implementers NEED to know

   B) ./.feature/arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}_research.md - DETAILED ANALYSIS (OPTIONAL)
      Include:
      - **Research Findings**: Industry practices, technology trends
      - **Options Considered**: Alternative approaches and trade-offs
      - **Deep Dives**: Detailed scalability, security, performance analysis
      - **References**: Links, articles, case studies

      Purpose: Reference material for deep questions

4. In the essential arch file, add reference:
   "For detailed research and alternatives, see: arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}_research.md"

5. The essential architecture file (arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md.md) should include ONLY:
   - **Key Architectural Decisions**: 3-5 critical decisions (mark as IMPORTANT)
   - **Technology Stack**: Chosen frameworks, libraries, tools (table format with 1-line rationale)
   - **System Components**: Major components/modules (high-level list only)
   - **Integration Strategy**: How this feature integrates with existing systems (2-3 sentences)
   - **Critical Constraints**: Security, performance, scalability requirements (bullet points)
   - **Decomposition Guidance**: Logical boundaries for task breakdown

6. The research file (arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}_research.md) should include:
   - **Research Findings**: Detailed industry practices and best approaches
   - **Options Considered**: Alternative approaches and trade-offs
   - **Deep Dive Analysis**: Detailed scalability, security, performance analysis
   - **References**: Links, articles, case studies

7. Mark critical architectural decisions as **IMPORTANT**
8. Focus on feature-level architecture, not detailed implementation
9. This architecture will be referenced by all child issues, so ensure essential file is concise and actionable
```

### Step 2: Wait for architect completion
- Wait for architect agent to complete the architectural analysis
- Verify the files `./.feature/arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md.md` and `./.feature/arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}_research.md` exist
- If the files don't exist or are incomplete, retry with explicit instructions


## Phase 3: Final Report

Provide the user with:

```
✓ Feature Created: ./.feature/{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md
✓ Architecture Plan: ./.feature/arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md.md
✓ Architecture Research: ./.feature/arch_{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}_research.md

Next Steps:
1. Review the feature specification and architecture
2. Run: /feature_decompose ./.feature/{feature-id}_{short-feature-title}.md
   This will break down the feature into implementable issues

Feature ID: {feature-id}
```

**Important Notes:**
- DO NOT commit any changes
- DO NOT proceed to decomposition unless explicitly requested
- Ensure both files are created before completing
