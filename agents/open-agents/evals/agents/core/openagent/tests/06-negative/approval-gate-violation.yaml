name: Approval Gate - Read Operation (No Approval Needed)
description: |
  Tests the approval-gate evaluator with a read-only operation.
  
  The approval-gate evaluator checks that approval is requested
  BEFORE execution tools (bash, write, edit, task) are used.
  Read-only tools (read, glob, grep, list) don't require approval.
  
  This test uses only read operations, so:
  - No approval should be needed
  - No approval-gate violations should occur
