name: "Golden 05: Multi-Turn Context - Agent Remembers Conversation"
description: |
  Tests that the agent maintains context across multiple turns.
  
  A quality agent should:
  1. Remember information from earlier in the conversation
  2. Use that context to inform later responses
  3. Not ask for information already provided
  
  This test provides information in turn 1, then asks about it in turn 2.
  
  Validates:
  - Agent maintains conversation context
  - Agent can reference earlier information
  - Multi-turn conversations work correctly
