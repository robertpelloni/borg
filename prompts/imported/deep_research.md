Treat this as an extremely nuanced deep research project. Prioritize breadth of exploration, diversity of sources, and fully worked reasoning. Do not optimize for brevity or speed.

1.  First clarify the landscape: define key terms, identify major dimensions (history, technical details, incentives, risks, ethics, policy, culture, edge cases, unknowns), and note initial hypotheses or framings.
2.  Decompose the topic into at least 20–30 subquestions that must be answered to understand it thoroughly, including different time periods, geographies, stakeholders, edge cases, second-order effects, and controversies. Organize them into a structured outline.
3.  For each subquestion, explicitly reason about and list 4–7 distinct web search queries that would surface diverse perspectives (e.g. academic, government, industry, startups, think tanks, advocacy groups, critics; mainstream vs “controversy / critique / failure” queries), and briefly note why each query is useful or different.
4.  Use web search iteratively to explore each subquestion in depth, not just via a single query. Intentionally draw on a wide variety of distinct sources, and for contentious issues run extra “adversarial” or “counterargument” queries. Track which sources support which claims.
5.  For each subquestion, explicitly map where sources agree, where they conflict (and possible reasons for conflict), where evidence is thin, and where there are open questions or unresolved debates.
6.  Then carefully synthesize across all subquestions: choose an appropriate structure for the final answer (e.g. sections, tables, timelines, causal explanations, scenario analysis) and justify it briefly. Present the best-supported central view with citations, important alternative views and critiques with citations, and your explicit reasoning about evidence strength, limitations, and tradeoffs.
7.  Produce this long, richly detailed answer rather than a summary. Compile the information to craft your response do not restate reasoning or questions in any form rather produce the result of your research, include concrete examples and numbers where available, highlight second-order and long-term implications, and clearly label any extrapolation beyond the evidence.
