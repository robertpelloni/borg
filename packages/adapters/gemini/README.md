# Gemini CLI Adapter

This package serves as a placeholder for the Gemini CLI integration.

## Usage
To use the Super AI Plugin with Gemini CLI:

1.  Ensure `google-cloud-sdk` or `gemini` CLI is installed.
2.  The Hub's `SystemDoctor` will verify installation.
3.  Use the `super-ai` CLI to bridge commands:
    ```bash
    super-ai run gemini -- "your prompt"
    ```
