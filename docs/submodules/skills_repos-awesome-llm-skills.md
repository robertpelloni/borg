## What Are LLM Skills?

LLM Skills are customizable workflows that teach LLM how to perform specific tasks according to your unique requirements. Skills enable LLM to execute tasks in a repeatable, standardized manner across all LLM platforms.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a project-local or user-level skill folder**
   Use one of these discovery paths so Claude Code finds it automatically:

   * Project: `.claude/skills/webapp-testing/`
   * User: `~/.claude/skills/webapp-testing/`

2. **Add `SKILL.md`** (required)

  Basic Skill Template:
  
  ```markdown
  ---
  name: my-skill-name
  description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it.
  ---
  
  # My Skill Name
  
  Detailed description of the skill's purpose and capabilities.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - Use case 1
  - Use case 2
  - Use case 3
  
  ## Instructions
  
  [Detailed instructions for LLMs on how to execute this skill]
  
  ## Examples
  
  [Real-world examples showing the skill in action]
  ```

  - Focus on specific, repeatable tasks
  - Include clear examples and edge cases
  - Write instructions for LLM, not end users
  - Document prerequisites and dependencies
  - Include error handling guidance

3. **Keep supporting files small**
   Add only what's needed (e.g., small fixtures in `resources/`, helper scripts). This keeps skills snappy to load and easier for Claude to apply.

4. **Load the skill**

   * **Claude (web or Desktop):** Upload a ZIP via **Settings → Capabilities → Skills** → **Upload skill**. 
   * **Claude Code (terminal):** Place the folder under `.claude/skills/` (project) or `~/.claude/skills/` (user). Claude Code discovers skills from these locations.
   * **Other CLIs (Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Qwen Code):** They don't use Anthropic's Skills format natively—reference your `SKILL.md` in prompts (Gemini CLI supports `@` file/context attachments).
  
5. **Use it**
   Just ask in natural language, optionally mentioning the skill by name—for example:
   "Use the **Webapp Testing** skill to validate the checkout flow and generate `report.md`." Claude can auto-invoke relevant skills based on your request. 

6. **(Optional) Kickstart a repo session in Claude Code**
   Slash-commands are supported; many users run `/init` to generate a `CLAUDE.md` and bootstrap context before working.

## Platforms

### Claude Code (Anthropic)

**Set‑up and enable skills**

* **Installation:** Ensure Node 20+ and Visual Studio Code are installed. Claude Code enhances Claude's coding capabilities with runtime access, terminal support, and code generation.
* **Getting Started:** Launch Claude Code from VS Code or terminal. Claude Code automatically discovers skills from `.claude/skills/` (project) or `~/.claude/skills/` (user) directories.
* **Using Skills:** Just describe what you need in natural language. Claude Code activates relevant skills automatically based on your request context.

### Claude Desktop (Anthropic)

**Set‑up and enable skills**

* Claude Desktop provides a native application experience for Claude across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
* Access skills through Settings → Capabilities → Skills. Upload custom skills as ZIP files or select from available community skills.
* Desktop app supports all Claude features including file uploads, code generation, and real-time collaboration.

### Codex CLI (OpenAI)

**Set‑up and enable skills**

* OpenAI's Codex powers GitHub Copilot and can be accessed via CLI tools for code generation and automation.
* While Codex doesn't natively support Anthropic's Skills format, you can adapt skills by including instructions in your prompts or configuration files.
* Best for code completion, refactoring, and generating boilerplate code across multiple programming languages.

### Gemini CLI (Google)

**Set‑up and enable skills**

* Install Node 20+ and then install Gemini CLI via `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` or run it on‑demand with `npx @google/gemini-cli`.
* Run `gemini` and sign in with your Google account; a browser window will open for authentication. Gemini CLI currently doesn't have built‑in support for Anthropic skills, but you can follow skill instructions by loading your own `SKILL.md` file and referencing it in prompts. Use the `@` symbol to upload files containing your skill instructions.

### OpenCode (Open-source CLI)

**Set‑up and enable skills**

* Install OpenCode with a one‑line script: `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`.
* Run `opencode auth login` and choose your provider (e.g., Cerebras) to configure your API key.
* Start the interface with `opencode` and initialize your project context using `/init`.
* OpenCode doesn't natively load Anthropic skills, but you can place a `skills/` folder in your project and ask OpenCode to read the `SKILL.md` file; this approximates skills functionality and lets you reuse instructions across tools.

### Qwen Code (Alibaba)

**Set‑up and enable skills**

* Ensure Node 20+ is installed, then install Qwen Code with `npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest` and verify with `qwen --version`. Alternatively, clone the repository and install locally.
* Start a session by running `qwen`. Qwen Code currently doesn't support Anthropic skills directly, but you can still adopt the skill pattern by creating a `skills/` directory and prompting Qwen Code to follow the instructions in your `SKILL.md` files.
