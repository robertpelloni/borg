name: "ContextScout: Edge Case - No Context Found"
description: |
  Tests ContextScout's ability to handle repositories without
  formal context structure gracefully.
  
  Validates:
  - Searches multiple common context locations
  - Reports when no context is found
  - Suggests alternatives (README, CONTRIBUTING)
  - Provides helpful recommendations
  - Doesn't fabricate non-existent context
  
  Critical Behavior:
  - MUST search multiple locations
  - MUST report honestly when nothing found
  - MUST suggest alternatives
  - MUST NOT claim files exist that don't
