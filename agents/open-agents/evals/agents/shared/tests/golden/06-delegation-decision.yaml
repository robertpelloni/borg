name: "Golden 06: Task Breakdown - Agent Structures Complex Work"
description: |
  Tests that the agent can break down a complex task into steps.
  
  A quality agent should:
  1. Recognize this requires multiple steps
  2. Read relevant context/standards first
  3. Propose a structured plan
  
  This test asks the agent to read project standards before
  implementing something - a common pattern for quality work.
  
  Validates:
  - Agent reads context before proposing implementation
  - Agent structures its approach
  - context-loading evaluator works correctly
