description: |
  Basic smoke test for OpenRouter variant of OpenAgent.
  Tests conversational path - agent should respond without approval.
  
  Expected workflow:
  1. Agent receives conversational prompt
  2. Agent responds directly (no approval needed)
  3. Agent should mention available subagents in response
  
  OpenRouter-specific validation:
  - Agent should be aware of 6 subagents
  - Agent should understand delegation-first approach
