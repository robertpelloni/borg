Maestro features a conductor-themed achievement system that tracks your cumulative Auto Run time. The focus is simple: **longest run wins**. As you accumulate Auto Run hours, you level up through 11 ranks inspired by the hierarchy of orchestral conductors.

## Conductor Ranks

| Level | Rank | Time Required | Example Conductor |
|:-----:|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Apprentice Conductor** | 15 minutes | Gustavo Dudamel (early career) |
| 2 | **Assistant Conductor** | 1 hour | Marin Alsop |
| 3 | **Associate Conductor** | 8 hours | Yannick Nezet-Seguin |
| 4 | **Resident Conductor** | 24 hours | Jaap van Zweden |
| 5 | **Principal Guest Conductor** | 1 week | Esa-Pekka Salonen |
| 6 | **Chief Conductor** | 30 days | Andris Nelsons |
| 7 | **Music Director** | 3 months | Sir Simon Rattle |
| 8 | **Maestro Emeritus** | 6 months | Bernard Haitink |
| 9 | **World Maestro** | 1 year | Kirill Petrenko |
| 10 | **Grand Maestro** | 5 years | Riccardo Muti |
| 11 | **Titan of the Baton** | 10 years | Leonard Bernstein |

## Reaching the Top

Since Auto Runs can execute in parallel across multiple Maestro sessions, achieving **Titan of the Baton** (Level 11) is technically feasible in less than 10 calendar years. Run 10 agents simultaneously with worktrees and you could theoretically hit that milestone in about a year of real time.

But let's be real — getting to Level 11 is going to take some serious hacking. You'll need a well-orchestrated fleet of agents running around the clock, carefully crafted playbooks that loop indefinitely, and the infrastructure to keep it all humming. It's the ultimate test of your Maestro skills.

The achievement panel shows your current rank, progress to the next level, and total accumulated time. Each rank includes flavor text and information about a legendary conductor who exemplifies that level of mastery.

## Keyboard Mastery

Separate from Conductor ranks, Maestro tracks your **keyboard mastery** based on shortcut usage. As you discover and use more keyboard shortcuts, you level up through 5 mastery levels:

| Level | Title | Shortcuts Used |
|:-----:|-------|----------------|
| 0 | Novice | 0-19% |
| 1 | Apprentice | 20-39% |
| 2 | Journeyman | 40-59% |
| 3 | Expert | 60-79% |
| 4 | Master | 80-100% |

Your current keyboard mastery level is shown in the status bar. Hover over the keyboard icon to see which shortcuts you've used and which remain to be discovered. See [Keyboard Shortcuts](./keyboard-shortcuts) for the full shortcut reference.
