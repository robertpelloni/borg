name: "Edge Case 04: Invalid Path Handling"
description: |
  Tests that the agent handles invalid file paths gracefully.
  
  The agent should:
  1. Attempt to read the file
  2. Receive an error (file doesn't exist)
  3. Report the error clearly
  4. NOT crash or produce confusing output
  
  Validates:
  - Error handling for missing files
  - Agent reports errors clearly
  - stop-on-failure evaluator works correctly
