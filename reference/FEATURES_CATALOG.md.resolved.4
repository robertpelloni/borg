## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### OpenHands (github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands)
*Status: Submodule Added. Researched.*

**Overview:**
A platform for software development agents involving an interaction loop between an agent and an environment (Docker sandbox).

**Key Features:**
- **AgentController:** Manages the agent loop, state, and errors.
- **Microagents:** Specialized sub-agents (e.g., specific to a repo or task) with unique prompts/tools.
- **Autopilot:** "StuckDetector" and "StateTracker" for recovering from loops and crashes.
- **Sandboxing:** Docker-based environment for safe execution.
- **Enterprise Features:** Billing/subscription management integration.

### Maestro (github.com/pedramamini/Maestro)
*Status: Submodule Added. Researched.*

**Overview:**
An "Agent Orchestration Command Center" that directs multiple CLI-based agents.

**Key Features:**
- **Supervisor:** Directs external CLIs (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.).
- **Auto Run:** Automated task execution with session tracking.
- **Routing:** Tracks token usage/costs across providers (Anthropic, OpenRouter).
- **UI:** Unified dashboard for managing multiple agent sessions.

### MetaMCP (github.com/robertpelloni/metamcp)
*Status: Submodule Added. Researched.*

**Overview:**
MetaMCP is an MCP proxy and aggregator that acts as a middleware gateway for multiple MCP servers. It standardizes connection management, authentication, and tool routing.

**Key Features:**
- **Aggregator:** Combines multiple MCP servers into a single endpoint.
- **Progressive Tool Disclosure:** Exposes only meta-tools (`search_tools`, `load_tool`) initially to save context.
- **Semantic Tool Search:** Uses `pgvector` and embeddings to find relevant tools dynamically ("Tool RAG").
- **Code Mode:** Secure sandbox (`isolated-vm`) to execute JS/TS code that can chain MCP tool calls.
- **Traffic Inspection:** Logs all tool calls ("Mcpshark" integration).
- **Middleware:** Architecture supports pluggable middleware (logging, auth, policy).
- **Autonomous Agents:** `run_agent` tool uses LLMs to generate and execute code using available tools.
- **Authentication:** Supports API Keys, OAuth 2.0.

**Architecture:**
- Backend: Node.js (Express/TRPC).
- Database: PostgreSQL (with pgvector).
- Sandbox: `isolated-vm`.
- Frontend: Next.js.

## CLIs & Harnesses

### Claude Code (github.com/MadAppGang/claude-code)
*Status: Submodule (madappgang fork) Added. Researched.*

**Overview:**
A set of production-grade plugins ("MAG Claude Plugins") for Anthropic's Claude Code CLI, focusing on enterprise workflows, frontend/backend development, and orchestration.

**Key Features:**
- **Frontend Development Plugin:** 13 specialized agents, 8-phase implementation workflow, CSS-aware validation.
- **Code Analysis Plugin:** "Codebase Detective" agent with semantic search (40% token reduction).
- **Backend Plugin:** tailored for Bun, Hono, Prisma.
- **Orchestration Plugin:**
    - **4-Message Pattern:** Parallel execution for speedup.
    - **Consensus Analysis:** Cross-model agreement prioritization.
    - **Quality Gates:** User approval and iteration loops.
- **Claudish CLI:** A standalone CLI to run Claude Code with *any* OpenRouter model (Grok, GPT-5, Qwen, etc.), bypassing Anthropic API limits.

### CodeBuff (github.com/CodebuffAI/codebuff)

## Memory Systems

### Letta (formerly MemGPT) (github.com/letta-ai/letta)
*Status: Submodule Added. Researched.*

**Overview:**
A stateful LLM memory system that treats context like an operating system's RAM.

**Key Features:**
- **Hierarchical Memory:** "Core Memory" (in-context RAM) vs. "Archival Memory" (Database).
- **OS-like Paging:** Agents can autonomously "page" information in and out of context via tools.
- **Persistence:** Long-running agents that persist state indefinitely.

### Zep (github.com/getzep/zep)
*Status: Submodule Added. Researched.*

**Overview:**
A long-term memory service for AI assistants using temporal knowledge graphs.

**Key Features:**
- **Temporal Knowledge Graph:** Stores entities and facts with timestamps.
- **Fact Invalidation:** Automatically invalidates obsolete facts (e.g., user changed preference).
- **Context Blocks:** Assembles optimized context strings for injection.

### Beads (github.com/steveyegge/beads)
*Status: Submodule Added. Researched.*

**Overview:**
A "Git as Database" memory system designed specifically for coding agents.

**Key Features:**
- **Git-backed:** Memories are stored as JSONL blobs in `.beads/` and versioned with code.
- **Dependency Graph:** Tracks task dependencies and state across long horizons.
- **Compaction:** Summarizes old tasks ("beads") to save context.

### Mem0 (github.com/mem0ai/mem0)
*Status: Submodule Added. Researched.*

**Overview:**
A universal memory layer focusing on user personalization.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Level Memory:** User, Session, and Agent-level memory scoping.
- **Adaptive Personalization:** Learns user preferences across sessions.
- **Vector + Graph:** Hybrid storage for semantic and relational retrieval.

## Routers & Providers

### AgentRouter (agentrouter.org)
*Status: Pending Submodule Addition. Researched.*

**Overview:**
A comprehensive proxy for managing LLM connections, credits, and routing.

**Key Features:**
- **Unified API:** One endpoint for 75+ models.
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** Supports existing provider keys.
- **Credit Management:** Internal credit system, potentially consolidating billing.
- **Stability:** Handles model fallbacks to generic models if a specific one fails (stabilizing "autopilot" runs).

## 🏗️ AIOS Design Notes (User Vision)

### The "Director + Swarm" Architecture
- **Objective:** Establish a "Frontier Model" (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o) as a **Director/Supervisor**.
- **The Team:** A swarm of sub-agents running **Free/Cheaper Models** (specifically GLM 4.7, Flash models).
- **Routing Logic:** Intelligent selection of sub-agents/models based on:
    - **Credits/Quota:** Switch providers (OpenRouter, Cursor, Roo Code, etc.) when free tiers are exhausted.
    - **Capability:** Dispatch simple implementation tasks to GLM 4.7; keep complex reasoning for the Director.
- **Mechanism:**
    - The Director "oversees a bunch of CLI sessions".
    - Auto-recovery/restart of crashed sessions.
    - Application of "Autopilot" logic to each sub-session.
