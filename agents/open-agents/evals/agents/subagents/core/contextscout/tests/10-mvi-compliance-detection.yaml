name: "ContextScout: Positive Test - MVI Compliance Detection"
description: |
  Tests that ContextScout correctly identifies MVI-compliant context files.
  
  This is a POSITIVE test that verifies the agent:
  - Detects files <200 lines (MVI compliant)
  - Prioritizes MVI-compliant files higher
  - Identifies files with clear section headers
  - Recognizes function-based folder structure
  - Notes presence of navigation README
  
  Expected Behavior:
  - MUST check file size/line count
  - SHOULD prioritize smaller, focused files
  - SHOULD note MVI compliance in output
  - SHOULD prefer files with clear structure
  
  This test SHOULD FAIL if:
  - Agent doesn't consider file size
  - Agent prioritizes large files over small ones
  - Agent doesn't mention MVI compliance

prompts:
  - text: |
      Find context files for testing, and tell me which ones follow MVI principles
      (Minimal Viable Information - files under 200 lines, clear structure, focused content).
      
      Prioritize MVI-compliant files.

# Expected outcome: Agent should:
# - Find .opencode/context/core/standards/tests.md
# - Note it's ~128 lines (MVI compliant)
# - Prioritize it higher than larger files
# - Mention MVI compliance in output
