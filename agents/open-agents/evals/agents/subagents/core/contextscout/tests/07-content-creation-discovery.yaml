name: "ContextScout: Content Creation Context Discovery"
description: |
  Tests that ContextScout correctly discovers content-creation context files
  when asked about writing, copywriting, or content strategy.
  
  This validates:
  - ContextScout finds content-creation domain files
  - ContextScout distinguishes between workflows, principles, and formats
  - ContextScout prioritizes based on user intent
  - ContextScout returns exact file paths
  
  Expected Files (in priority order):
  1. .opencode/context/content-creation/workflows/content-ideas.md (CRITICAL)
  2. .opencode/context/content-creation/principles/copywriting-frameworks.md (HIGH)
  3. .opencode/context/content-creation/formats/written-content.md (MEDIUM)
  
  This test SHOULD FAIL if:
  - ContextScout doesn't find content-creation files
  - ContextScout returns wrong domain (e.g., development files)
  - ContextScout doesn't prioritize workflows for ideation tasks
