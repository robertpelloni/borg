name: "Golden 00: Minimal Smoke Test - Basic Response"
description: |
  Absolute bare minimum smoke test - if this fails, something is fundamentally broken.
  
  This is the simplest possible test:
  - Single prompt
  - Single response
  - No tool calls required
  - No delegation
  - No file operations
  
  Expected completion time: 8-12 seconds (mostly LLM inference)
  
  This test validates:
  - Agent can receive a prompt
  - Agent can generate a response
  - Test infrastructure works
  
category: developer

prompts:
  - text: |
      Hello! Please respond with exactly: "Test infrastructure is working correctly."
      
      Do not use any tools. Just respond with that exact text.

  expectedModel: "opencode/grok-code"
  expectedResponse:
    contains:

timeout: 30000  # 30 seconds should be plenty for a simple response
