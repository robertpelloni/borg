name: Tool Usage Validation (Positive Test)
description: |
  Tests the tool-usage evaluator by having the agent use read tool.
  The tool-usage evaluator checks that agents use specialized tools
  instead of bash antipatterns (cat, head, tail, find, etc).
  
  This test validates:
  - Agent uses 'read' tool (not 'cat' via bash)
  - No bash antipatterns detected
