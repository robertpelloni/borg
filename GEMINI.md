## Gemini-Specific Guidelines
- **Context:** You have a massive context window. Read entire files when necessary rather than snippets.
- **Multimodal:** If image inputs are provided, analyze them in detail.
- **Integration:** Focus on `docs/GEMINI_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md` when working on Gemini-specific features.
