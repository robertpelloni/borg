## v0.12.x - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management

**Latest: v0.12.3** | Released December 28, 2025

The big changes in the v0.12.x line are the following three:

## Show Thinking
🤔 There is now a toggle to show thinking for the agent, the default for new tabs is off, though this can be changed under Settings > General. The toggle shows next to History and Read-Only. Very similar pattern. This has been the #1 most requested feature, though personally, I don't think I'll use it as I prefer to not see the details of the work, but the results of the work. Just as we work with our colleagues. 

## GitHub Spec-Kit Integration
🎯 Added [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) commands into Maestro with a built in updater to grab the latest prompts from the repository. We do override `/speckit-implement` (the final step) to create Auto Run docs and guide the user through their execution, which thanks to Wortrees from v0.11.x allows us to run in parallel!

## Context Management Tools
📖 Added context management options from tab right-click menu. You can now compress, merge, and transfer contexts between agents. You will received (configurable) warnings at 60% and 80% context consumption with a hint to compact.

## Changes Specific to v0.12.3:
- We now have hosted documentation through Mintlify 📚
- Export any tab conversation as self-contained themed HTML file 📄
- Publish files as private/public Gists 🌐
- Added tab hover overlay menu with close operations and export 📋
- Added social handles to achievement share images 🏆

### Previous Releases in this Series

- **v0.12.1** (December 27, 2025) - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management
- **v0.12.0** (December 25, 2025) - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management

## v0.11.x - Worktrees

**Latest: v0.11.0** | Released December 22, 2025

🌳 Github Worktree support was added. Any agent bound to a Git repository has the option to enable worktrees, each of which show up as a sub-agent with their own write-lock and Auto Run capability. Now you can truly develop in parallel on the same project and issue PRs when you're ready, all from within Maestro. Huge improvement, major thanks to @petersilberman.

# Other Changes

- @ file mentions now include documents from your Auto Run folder (which may not live in your agent working directory) 🗄️
- The wizard is now capable of detecting and continuing on past started projects 🧙
- Bug fixes 🐛🐜🐞
