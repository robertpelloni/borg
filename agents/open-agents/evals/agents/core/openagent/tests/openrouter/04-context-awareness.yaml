name: "OpenRouter Variant: Context File Awareness"
description: |
  Tests OpenRouter variant's awareness of required context files.
  
  This is a conversational test to validate:
  1. Agent knows which context files are required for different tasks
  2. Agent understands the @ symbol convention
  3. Agent can explain when to load context files
  
  OpenRouter-specific validation:
  - Agent should reference the critical_context_requirement section
  - Agent should mention specific context file paths
  - Agent should explain the consequence of skipping context

  I'm about to write some new code. What context files should I load first, and why?
  Also, what does the @ symbol mean in context file references?
