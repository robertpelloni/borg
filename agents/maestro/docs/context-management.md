## Tab Menu

Hover over any tab with an established session to access the tab menu overlay:

![Tab Menu](./screenshots/tab-menu.png)

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Copy Session ID** | Copy the session ID to clipboard (for session continuity) |
| **Star Session** | Bookmark this session for quick access |
| **Rename Tab** | Give the tab a descriptive name |
| **Mark as Unread** | Add unread indicator to the tab |
| **Context: Copy to Clipboard** | Copy the full conversation to clipboard |
| **Context: Compact** | Compress context while preserving key information |
| **Context: Merge Into** | Merge this context into another session |
| **Context: Send to Agent** | Transfer context to a different agent |

### Tab Close Operations

The tab menu also provides bulk close operations for managing multiple tabs:

![Tab Close - Center Tab](./screenshots/tab-close-center.png)

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Close** | Close the current tab |
| **Close Others** | Close all tabs except this one |
| **Close Tabs to the Left** | Close all tabs to the left of this one |
| **Close Tabs to the Right** | Close all tabs to the right of this one |

These operations respect the **Unread Filter**: when the filter is active, only visible tabs are affected — hidden "read" tabs are preserved.

**Position-aware options:** The menu intelligently hides inapplicable options:
- First tab: "Close Tabs to the Left" is disabled
- Last tab: "Close Tabs to the Right" is disabled
- Single tab: "Close" and "Close Others" are disabled

![Tab Close - Left Tab](./screenshots/tab-close-left.png)
![Tab Close - Right Tab](./screenshots/tab-close-right.png)

All close operations support **undo** — press `Cmd+Shift+T` / `Ctrl+Shift+T` to reopen recently closed tabs (up to 25 tabs are remembered).

These actions are also available via **Quick Actions** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) with keyboard shortcuts displayed:

## Tab Export

Export any tab conversation as a self-contained HTML file:

1. Right-click the tab → **Context: Copy to Clipboard**
2. Or use **Command Palette** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Export tab to HTML"

The exported HTML file includes:
- **Full conversation history** with all messages
- **Your current theme colors** — the export adopts your active Maestro theme
- **Maestro branding** with links to the website and GitHub
- **Session metadata** — agent type, working directory, timestamps, token usage
- **Rendered markdown** — code blocks, tables, and formatting preserved

This is useful for sharing conversations, creating documentation, or archiving important sessions.

Context management lets you combine or transfer conversation history between sessions and agents, enabling powerful workflows where you can:

- **Compact & continue** — Compress your context to stay within token limits while preserving key information
- **Merge sessions** — Combine context from multiple conversations into one
- **Transfer to other agents** — Send your context to a different AI agent (e.g., Claude Code → Codex)

## Context Window Warnings

As your conversation grows, Maestro monitors context window usage and displays warnings when you're approaching limits.

![Context Warning Banner](./screenshots/context-warnings.png)

The warning banner appears below the input box showing:
- Current context usage percentage
- **Compact & Continue** button for one-click context compression

### Why Context Usage Matters

**Operating near context limits degrades AI performance.** When context reaches ~80% capacity or higher:

- The AI loses access to earlier parts of your conversation
- Important decisions, code changes, and context get pushed out
- Response quality drops as the model struggles to maintain coherence
- You may experience more hallucinations and forgotten instructions

For best results, **compact your context before reaching 60-70% usage** — don't wait for the red warning.

### Configuring Warnings

Customize warning thresholds in **Settings** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`) → **General** → **Context Window Warnings**:

![Context Warning Configuration](./screenshots/context-warnings-config.png)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Show context consumption warnings** | Enabled | Toggle warning banners on/off |
| **Yellow warning threshold** | 60% | Early warning — good time to consider compacting |
| **Red warning threshold** | 80% | Critical — compact immediately to avoid degradation |

**Recommended thresholds:**
- Set yellow to **50-60%** if you prefer earlier warnings
- Set red to **70-80%** — going higher risks quality degradation
- Lower both thresholds if you frequently work on complex tasks that require the AI to remember many details

## Compact & Continue

When your conversation approaches context limits, you can compress it while preserving essential information:

1. **Right-click** a tab → **"Context: Compact"**, or use **Command Palette** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Context: Compact"
2. The AI compacts the conversation, extracting key decisions, code changes, and context
3. A new tab opens with the compressed context, ready to continue working

**When to use:**
- The context warning sash appears (yellow at 60%, red at 80% usage)
- You want to continue a long conversation without losing important context
- You need to free up context space for new tasks

**What gets preserved:**
- Key decisions and their rationale
- Code changes and file modifications
- Important technical details and constraints
- Current task state and next steps

### How Compaction Works

Compaction uses a multi-pass approach to handle conversations of any size:

**Eligibility Check:**
Compaction requires either:
- Context usage ≥ 25% (as reported by the agent), OR
- Estimated conversation size ≥ 10,000 tokens (~40k characters)

The second condition handles cases where the agent doesn't report context usage but the conversation is clearly large enough to benefit from compaction.

**Single-Pass Compaction (< 50k tokens):**
For smaller conversations, the entire context is sent to a fresh AI agent in batch mode, which returns a compressed summary.

**Chunked Compaction (≥ 50k tokens):**
For larger conversations that exceed 50,000 tokens:

1. **Chunking** — The conversation is split into chunks of ~50k tokens each
2. **Parallel summarization** — Each chunk is sent to a separate batch-mode agent process
3. **Combination** — Chunk summaries are combined together
4. **Consolidation** — If the combined result exceeds 40k tokens, additional passes reduce it further

**Consolidation Passes:**
When chunk summaries combine to more than 40k tokens, the system performs up to 3 consolidation passes:

- Each pass asks the AI to aggressively reduce the summary while preserving key information
- A pass is only accepted if it reduces size by at least 10%
- Consolidation stops early if no meaningful reduction is achieved

This ensures that even a conversation at 95%+ context capacity (e.g., 190k tokens) will be compacted to a manageable size (~40k tokens or less) that leaves room for continued work.

**Progress Indicators:**
During compaction, you'll see status updates:
- "Extracting context..." — Preparing the conversation
- "Summarizing chunk 1/4..." — Processing large conversations in parts
- "Consolidation pass 1/3..." — Additional reduction passes if needed
- "Finalizing compacted context..." — Creating the new tab

## Merging Sessions

Combine context from multiple sessions or tabs into one:

1. **Right-click** a tab → **"Context: Merge Into"**, or use **Command Palette** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Merge with another session"
2. Search for or select the target session/tab from the modal
3. Review the merge preview showing estimated token count
4. Optionally enable **Clean context** to remove duplicates and reduce size
5. Click **"Merge Into"**

![Merge Modal](./screenshots/tab-merge.png)

The modal shows:
- **Paste ID** tab — Enter a specific session ID directly
- **Open Tabs** tab — Browse all open tabs across all agents
- **Token estimate** — Shows source size and estimated size after cleaning
- **Agent grouping** — Tabs organized by agent with tab counts

The merged context creates a new tab in the target session with conversation history from both sources. Use this to consolidate related conversations or bring context from an older session into a current one.

**What gets merged:**
- Full conversation history (user messages and AI responses)
- Token estimates are shown before merge to help you stay within context limits

**Tips:**
- You can merge tabs within the same session or across different sessions
- Large merges (100k+ tokens) will show a warning but still proceed
- Self-merge (same tab to itself) is prevented
- Enable "Clean context" for large merges to reduce token count

## Sending to Another Agent

Transfer your context to a different AI agent:

1. **Right-click** a tab → **"Context: Send to Agent"**, or use **Command Palette** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Send to another agent"
2. Search for or select the target agent from the list
3. Review the token estimate and cleaning options
4. Click **"Send to Session"**

![Send to Agent Modal](./screenshots/tab-send.png)

The modal shows:
- **Searchable agent list** with status indicators (Idle, Busy, etc.)
- **Agent paths** to distinguish between agents with similar names
- **Token estimate** — Shows source size and estimated size after cleaning
- **Clean context option** — Remove duplicates and reduce size before transfer

**Context Cleaning:**
When transferring between agents, the context can be automatically cleaned to:
- Remove duplicate messages and verbose output
- Condense while preserving key information
- Optimize token usage for the target session

Cleaning is enabled by default but can be disabled for verbatim transfers.

**Use Cases:**
- Start a task in Claude Code, then hand off to Codex for a different perspective
- Transfer a debugging session to an agent with different tool access
- Move context to an agent pointing at a different project directory
- Share context with a worktree sub-agent working on the same codebase
