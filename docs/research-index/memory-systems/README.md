# Memory Systems

**Purpose**: Short-term, long-term, archival memory systems and vector stores

## Overview

Memory systems provide persistent storage and retrieval of context across AI sessions. This category tracks vector stores, memory architectures, and MCP memory servers for Borg's universal memory management.

## Integration Strategy

1. **Add as submodules** for reference
2. **Implement pluggable memory backend** architecture
3. **Support multiple backends simultaneously** (configurable per session)
4. **Create conversion utilities** between memory formats
5. **Build universal memory MCP** that exposes all backends
6. **Implement auto-memory-harvesting** from sessions
7. **Add memory browser UI** for inspection
8. **Create import/export** functionality

---

## Borg Memory Architecture

Borg should provide:
- **Multi-backend support**: Chroma, Qdrant, Mem0, Letta, SuperMemory, etc.
- **Short-term memory**: Session context with pruning/summarization
- **Long-term memory**: Persistent vector store with semantic search
- **Archival memory**: Compressed storage of old sessions
- **Memory compaction**: Automatic summarization and pruning
- **Memory RAG**: Semantic search across all memories
- **Memory conversion**: Import/export between any systems
- **Auto-harvesting**: Extract important context during sessions
- **Memory browser**: Visual inspection of stored memories
- **MCP memory**: Universal memory server for all clients
