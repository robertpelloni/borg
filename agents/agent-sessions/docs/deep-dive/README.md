# Agent Sessions Deep Dive (10/10)

This folder contains a deep product + architecture analysis of Agent Sessions, focused on:
- A refactor roadmap for maintainability and scale
- Competitive landscape (adjacent tools, threats, and opportunities)
- A modern “vibe coding” workflow blueprint (agentic dev loops)
- A ballast audit (what to cut, hide, or de-scope)
- A growth plan (how to reach 1,000 stars and/or monetize)
